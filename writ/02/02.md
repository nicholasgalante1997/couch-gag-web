#### Good Will Hunted

"And so, Robin Williams, as I stood there in my kitchen, shoveling spoonfuls of fruity pebbles into my mouth over the counter, It threw itself at me.", Teddy.

"I've asked you almost a dozen times to stop calling me Robin Williams.", Robin Williams.

"My wife is dead chief.", Teddy murmured robotically under his breath, barely audible.

"What threw itself at you?" Robin redirected.

"Well, I saw the steak knife, then I saw the other steak knife, sharper yet, and then I saw 'Being and Time' and I was like, I don't know, maybe infatuated with the opportunity."

"The opportunity for wh-" He already knew, but he wanted Teddy to say It.

"The opportunity to shiv one or both of those steak knives in my neck and bleed out in my kitchen all over 'Being and Time'."

"Hmmm."

"Okay so, I'm sensing apprehension. Give me a moment. I thought, 'That would be fucking hysterical. To like run out of time and stop being, all over Being and Time." 

"I don't think it's that funny, It's not even really sensible." Robin furrowed his brow, saddened. Teddy furrowed his brow, aggravated. "Do you like that book? Do you agree with Heidegger?"

"You know I wouldn't know. I haven't read it. I just had it there on the counter. Saw the shiv- er knives. And presto. Here we are, 4 months later." 

"Uh-huh. And where are we Teddy?"
